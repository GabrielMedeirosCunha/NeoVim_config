treesitter needs to be compiled,
therefore, a C compiler needs to be installed 
and putted in the path of your system.

linux distributions dont need to worry about this,
but windows generally does not comes with a C compiler
as a default.

treesitter accepts (for windows) Mingw, llvm, MSVC and zig.
