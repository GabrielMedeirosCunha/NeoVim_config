-- LSP servers and clients are able to communicate to each other what features they support.
--  By default, Neovim doesn't support everything that is in the LSP specification.
--  When you add nvim-cmp, luasnip, etc. Neovim now has *more* capabilities.
--  So, we create new capabilities with nvim cmp, and then broadcast that to the servers.
local capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()
capabilities = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', capabilities, require('cmp_nvim_lsp').default_capabilities())

-- Enable the following language servers
--  Feel free to add/remove any LSPs that you want here. They will automatically be installed.
--
--  Add any additional override configuration in the following tables. Available keys are:
--  - cmd (table): Override the default command used to start the server
--  - filetypes (table): Override the default list of associated filetypes for the server
--  - capabilities (table): Override fields in capabilities. Can be used to disable certain LSP features.
--  - settings (table): Override the default settings passed when initializing the server.
--        For example, to see the options for `lua_ls`, you could go to: https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/
